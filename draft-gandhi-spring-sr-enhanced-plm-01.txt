1.  Introduction

   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-
   MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes [RFC8402].  SR takes advantage of
   the Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy] are
   used to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a
   stack of Segments.  Built-in Liveness Monitoring for detecting faults
   as well as Performance Delay Measurement (DM) and Loss Measurement
   (LM) are essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements
   (SLAs) in SR networks.

Internet-Draft  Performance and Liveness Monitoring in SR       May 2020


   The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) defined in [RFC4656]
   and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) defined in [RFC5357]
   provide capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks using probe messages.  The TWAMP Light
   [Appendix I in RFC 5357] provides simplified mechanisms for active
   performance measurement in Customer IP networks by provisioning UDP
   paths that eliminates the need for control-channel signaling.
   Similarly, the Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
   [RFC8762] alleviates the need for control-channel signaling by using
   configuration data model to provision a test-channel.
   [I-D.gandhi-spring-twamp-srpm] defines procedure for using TWAMP
   Light messages with user-defined IP/UDP paths in SR networks and is
   applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.
   [I-D.gandhi-spring-stamp-srpm] defines similar procedure using STAMP
   messages.

   For Liveness Monitoring, Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
   (S-BFD) [RFC7880] can be used in Segment Routing networks.  However,
   S-BFD requires protocol support on the reflector node to process the
   S-BFD packets as packets are punted from forwarding path in order to
   send reply thereby limiting the scale for number of sessions and
   fault detection interval.  In addition, S-BFD protocol does not have
   the capability today to enable performance delay and loss monitoring
   in SR networks.  Enabling multiple protocols in SR networks, S-BFD
   for liveness monitoring and TWAMP Light or STAMP for performance
   delay and loss monitoring increases the deployment and operational
   complexities in SR networks.

   This document defines procedure for Performance Delay and Liveness
   Monitoring (PDLM) in Segment Routing networks.  The procedure uses
   the probe messages defined in [RFC5357] (TWAMP Light) and [RFC8762]
   (STAMP) for SR Paths including SR Policies with both SR-MPLS and SRv6
   data planes.

2.4.  Loopback Mode

   In loopback mode, the sender node R1 initiates probe messages and the
   reflector node R5 forwards them back to the sender node R1 just like
   data packets for the normal traffic.  The probe messages are not
   punted at the reflector node and it does not process them and
   generate response messages.  The reflector node must not drop the
   loopback probe messages, for example, due to a local policy
   provisioned on the node.

3.  Protocol Overview

   The TWAMP Light probe messages for delay measurement as defined in
   [RFC5357] or STAMP probe messages as defined in [RFC8762] are sent by
   the sender node R1 to the reflector node R5 in loopback mode as shown
   in Figure 1.  The probe messages are sent by the sender node on the
   congruent path of the data traffic flowing on the SR Path.

   The UDP destination port number in the probe message is user-
   configured from the range specified in [RFC8762].  The Source and
   Destination IP addresses in the probe messages are set to the
   reflector and the sender node addresses, respectively.  The IPv4 Time
   To Live (TTL) and IPv6 Hop Limit (HL) are set to 255.

   No PM session is created on the reflector node R5.  As the probe
   message is not punted on the reflector node for processing, the
   Sender copies the 'Sequence Number' in 'Session-Sender Sequence
   Number' field directly.  Also, the Sender Timestamp, Sender Error
   Estimate and Sender TTL fields [RFC5357] [RFC8762] in the probe
   message are not used.

3.1.  Example Provisioning Model

   An example of a provisioning model and typical measurement parameters
   for the user-configured destination UDP port is shown in Figure 2:

   Example of Measurement Protocol is TWAMP Light and STAMP, example of
   Timestamp Format is PTPv2 [IEEE1588] and NTP, etc.

   The mechanisms to provision the sender and reflector nodes are
   outside the scope of this document.

4.  Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring

   For performance delay and liveness monitoring of an SR Path including
   SR Policy, loopback mode is used.  The PM probe messages are sent by
   the sender head-end node R1 to the reflector endpoint node R5 of the
   SR Policy as shown in Figure 1.

   The probe messages are sent using the Segment List (SL) of the
   Candidate-paths of the SR Policy
   [I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy].  When a Candidate-path has
   more than one Segment Lists, multiple probe messages are sent, one
   using each Segment List.  The probe messages are received back by the
   sender node via IP/UDP [RFC0768] return path by default.  The Segment
   List of the return SR path can be added in the probe message header
   to receive the probe response on a specific path using the mechanisms
   defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-binding-label-sid] and
   [I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path].

   Liveness failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe
   messages are not received back at the sender, where N is locally
   provisioned value.  For delay measurement, the timestamps t1 and t4

   collected by the probes are used to measure round-trip delay.  The
   delay metrics are notified when consecutive M number of probe
   messages have measured delay values violate user-configured
   threshold, where M is also locally provisioned value.

4.1.  Probe Message for SR-MPLS

   The TWAMP Light or STAMP probe messages for SR-MPLS data plane are
   sent using the MPLS header containing the label stack of the SR
   Policy as shown in Figure 3.  In case of IP/UDP return path, the MPLS
   header is removed by the reflector node.  The label stack can contain
   a reverse SR-MPLS path to receive the reply on a specific path.  In
   this case, the MLS header will not be removed by the reflector node.

   including SR Policy is defined using the loopback mode enabled with
   network programming.  The network programming function optimizes the
   "operations of punt, add receive timestamp and inject the probe
   packet" on the reflector node and is implemented in hardware.  In
   this mode, both transmit (t1) and receive (t2) timestamps in data
   plane are collected by the probe messages sent in loopback mode as
   shown in Figure 5.  The payload of the probe message is not modified
   by any intermediate nodes.

   The sender node adds transmit (t1) timestamp in the payload of the
   TWAMP Light or STAMP probe message and clears the receive (t2)
   timestamp.  The endpoint node adds the receive timestamp (at the
   fixed location locally provisioned consistently in the network) in
   the payload of the received TWAMP Light or STAMP probe message
   without punting the probe message in control-plane.  The reflector
   endpoint node only adds the receive timestamp if the source address
   in the probe message matches the local node address to ensure that
   the receive timestamp is returned by the intended endpoint node.  In
   addition, the UDP port in the probe message must be locally
   programmed for adding the timestamp in the probe message.  The one-
   way delay is measured using the receive (t2) and transmit (t1)
   timestamps in the probe message.

   Timestamp format recommended is 64-bit PTPv2 [IEEE1588] as specified
   in [RFC8186] implemented in hardware.  Note that the timestamp format
   can be locally provisioned as part of enabling the network
   programming function.  In addition to adding the timestamp in the
   message, the "Error Estimate" field in the payload of the message is
   updated using the procedure defined in [RFC4656].

   The network programming function is enabled to add receive timestamp
   in the payload of the probe message at a specific location which is
   also locally provisioned.  In TWAMP Light message defined in
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC5357] or STAMP message defined in [RFC8762] for
   delay measurement, the 64-bit receive timestamp is added at byte-
   offset 16 which is from the start of the payload.

   Liveness failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe
   messages are not received back at the sender, where N is locally
   provisioned value.  Similarly, delay metrics are notified when
   consecutive M number of probe messages have measured delay values
   violate user-configured threshold, where M is also locally
   provisioned value.

5.1.  Probe Message with Network Programming for SR-MPLS

   In this document, new Timestamp Label (special purpose label with
   value TBD1) is defined for SR-MPLS data plane to enable network
   programming function for timestamp, pop and forward the received
   packet.

   In the probe message with network programming for SR-MPLS, Timestamp
   Label is added in the MPLS header as shown in Figure 6, to collect
   "Receive Timestamp" field in the payload of the TWAMP Light [RFC5357]
   or STAMP probe message.  When a node receives a message with
   Timestamp Label, other than timestamping the message at a fixed
   location, the node pops the Timestamp Label and forwards the message
   using the next label or IP header in the message (just like the data
   packets for the normal traffic).

5.1.1.  Node Capability for Timestamp Label

   The ingress node needs to know if the egress node can process the
   Timestamp Label.  The signaling extension for this capability
   exchange is outside the scope of this document.

   Another way is to leverage a centralized controller (e.g., SDN
   controller) to program the ingress and egress nodes.  In this case,
   the controller MUST make sure (e.g., by some capability discovery
   mechanisms outside the scope of this document) that the egress node
   can process the Timestamp Label.

5.2.  Probe Message with Network Programming for SRv6

   In this document, new Endpoint function "Timestamp and Forward (TSF)"
   (value TBD2) is defined for Segment Routing Header (SRH) [RFC8754]
   for SRv6 data plane to enable network programming function for
   timestamp and forward the received message.

   In the probe message with network programming for SRv6, END.TSF
   function is added for the Endpoint Segment Identifier (SID) in SRH
   [RFC8754] as shown in Figure 7, to collect "Receive Timestamp" field
   in the payload of the TWAMP Light [RFC5357] or STAMP probe message.
   When a node receives a packet with END.TSF function for the target
   SID which is local, other than timestamping the packet at a fixed
   location, the node forwards the packet using the next SID or IP
   header in the packet (just like the packets for the normal traffic).

6.  ECMP Handling

   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  The
   PM probe messages need to be sent to traverse different ECMP paths to
   monitor the liveness for an SR Policy.

   Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  In IPv4 header of the PM probe
   messages, sweeping of Destination Address in 127/8 range can be used
   to exercise different ECMP paths in the loopback mode as long as the
   return path is also SR-MPLS.  The Flow Label field in the outer IPv6
   header can also be used for sweeping to exercise different ECMP
   paths.

7.  Security Considerations

   The Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring is intended for
   deployment in the well-managed private and service provider networks.
   As such, it assumes that a node involved in a monitoring operation
   has previously verified the integrity of the path and the identity of

   the far-end reflector node.  If desired, attacks can be mitigated by
   performing basic validation and sanity checks, at the sender, of the
   counter or timestamp fields in received measurement response
   messages.  The minimal state associated with these protocols also
   limits the extent of disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or
   invalid message to a single query/response cycle.  Use of HMAC-
   SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data integrity of the
   probe messages.  Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the
   correct configuration of access-control lists and firewalls.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA maintains the "Special-Purpose Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS) Label Values" registry (see <https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   mpls-label-values/mpls-label-values.xml>).  IANA is requested to
   allocate Timestamp Label value from the "Extended Special-Purpose
   MPLS Label Values" registry:

       | Value       | Description             | Reference     |
       +-------------+-------------------------+---------------+
       | TBA1        | Timestamp Label         | This document |
       +-------------+-------------------------+---------------+

   IANA is requested to allocate, within the "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors
   Registry" sub-registry belonging to the top-level "Segment-routing
   with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) Parameters" registry
   [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], the following
   allocations:
