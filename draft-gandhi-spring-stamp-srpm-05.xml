    <section title="Introduction" anchor="sect-1"><t>
   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes <xref target="RFC8402"/>.  SR takes advantage of the
   Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> are used
   to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack
   of Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the
   essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs).</t>

   <t>The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks <xref target="RFC8762"/>. 
   It eliminates the need for control protocol by using
   configuration and management model to provision and manage test sessions. 
   <xref target="RFC8972"/> defines optional extensions for STAMP.
   <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/> defines STAMP extensions for SR networks.</t>

   <t>The STAMP supports two modes of STAMP Session-Reflector: Stateless and Stateful 
   as described in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC8762"/>. 
   In SR networks, Stateless mode of Session-Reflector is desired 
   to be able to support high number of STAMP sessions.
   In Stateless mode, provisioning of each test session on Session-Reflector
   node is avoided. In SR networks, as 
   the state is in the packet, the signaling of the parameters is undesired.</t> 

   <t>This document describes procedures  
   for Performance Measurement (PM) in SR networks using the 
   mechanisms defined in STAMP <xref target="RFC8762"/> 
   and its optional extensions defined in <xref target="RFC8972"/> 
   and <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>. 
   The procedure described is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and
   is used for both links and end-to-end SR paths including SR Policies and Flex-Algo IGP Paths.  
   Unless otherwise specified, the mechanisms 
   defined in <xref target="RFC8762"/>, <xref target="RFC8972"/> and 
   <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>

   In the reference topology shown below, the STAMP Session-Sender R1 initiates a
   STAMP test packet and the STAMP Session-Reflector R3
   transmits a reply test packet.  The reply test packet is 
   transmitted back to the STAMP Session-Sender R1 
   on the same path or a different path in the reverse direction.</t>  

   <t>SR is enabled on nodes R1 and R3. The nodes R1 and R3 may be
   connected via a link or there exists an SR path <xref target="RFC8402"/>.  
   The link may be a physical interface, virtual link, 
   or Link Aggregation Group (LAG) [IEEE802.1AX], or LAG member link. 
   The SR path may be an SR Policy <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> 
   on node R1 (called head-end) with destination to node R3 (called tail-end).</t>

   <section title="Overview" anchor="sect-3"><t>
   For performance measurement in SR networks, 
   the STAMP test packets defined in <xref target="RFC8762"/> 
   and its optional extensions defined in <xref target="RFC8972"/> 
   and <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/> are used as 
   described in this document.</t> 
   
   <t>For performance delay and packet loss measurement, 
   STAMP Session-Sender test packets are transmitted in-band on the
   same path as the customer data traffic 
   to measure the delay and packet loss experienced by the customer data traffic.
   It may be desired in SR networks that return 
   test packets are also transmitted in-band on the same path in the reverse direction.
   This is achieved by using the STAMP extensions defined in 
   <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>.</t> 

   <t>A destination UDP port number is selected as described in
   <xref target="RFC8762"/>.  The same destination UDP 
   port is used for link and end-to-end SR path STAMP sessions.</t>

    <section title="Example STAMP Reference Model" anchor="sect-3.1"><t>
   An example of a STAMP reference model and typical measurement session 
   parameters including the destination UDP port 
   for STAMP session is shown in the following Figure 1:</t>

    <t>Example of the Timestamp Format is PTPv2 <xref target="IEEE1588"/> or NTP. 
    Example of Delay Measurement Mode is one-way, two-way and loopback mode.
    Example of Packet Loss Type is stateful and stateless <xref target="RFC8762"/> 
    for test packet loss, and direct measurement for data packet loss.</t>

    <t>When using the authenticated mode for delay measurement, the matching
    Authentication Type (e.g. HMAC-SHA-256) and Key are user-configured
    on STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector <xref target="RFC8762"/>.</t>

    <t>The YANG data model defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-yang"/>
    can be used to provision the STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector.</t>

    <t>Note that the reference model is not intended for signaling the SR parameters between the 
    STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector.
    The STAMP Session-Reflector R3 uses the parameters for the timestamp format and
    return path for the reply test packet from the received STAMP test packet.</t>

   <section title="One-way Delay Measurement Mode" anchor="sect-4.2.1"><t>
   In one-way delay measurement mode, a reply test packet
   as defined in Figure 5 is transmitted back to the STAMP Session-Sender,
   for both links and SR Policies.  In this mode, the Control Code is set to 0 
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm] in the STAMP Session-Sender test packets.
   In this mode, as per Reference Topology, 
   all timestamps T1, T2, T3, and T4 are collected by the test packets.
   However, only timestamps T1 and T2 are used to measure one-way delay as (T2 - T1).</t>

   <t>The STAMP Session-Sender address may not
   be reachable via IP route from the STAMP Session-Reflector.  The STAMP Session-Sender
   in this case can send its reachability path information to the
   STAMP Session-Reflector using the Return Path TLV defined 
   in <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>.</t>

    </section>

   <section title="Two-way Delay Measurement Mode" anchor="sect-4.2.2"><t>
   In two-way delay measurement mode, 
   the reply test packet as shown in Figure 5 is transmitted in-band 
   to the STAMP Session-Sender on the same path as the data traffic on the
   reverse direction link or associated reverse SR path
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path"/>.  In this mode, as per Reference Topology, 
   all timestamps T1, T2, T3, and T4 are collected by the test packets.
   All four timestamps are used to measure two-way delay as ((T4 - T1) - (T3 - T2)).</t>

   <t>For two-way delay measurement mode for links, the reply test packet is transmitted in-band on 
   the same link where the test packet is received.
   For this purpose, the Control Code is 
   set to "In-band Response Requested" <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/> in 
   the STAMP Session-Sender test packets for links.</t>

   <t>For two-way delay measurement mode for SR Policy, the STAMP Session-Reflector needs to transmit
   the reply test packet in-band on a specific reverse path.  The STAMP Session-Sender
   node can request in the test packet to the STAMP Session-Reflector to
   transmit the reply test packet back on a given reverse path 
   using Return Path TLV defined in <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>.
   In this mode for SR Policy, the Control Code is set to 0

   <section title="Loopback Measurement Mode" anchor="sect-4.2.3"><t>
   The loopback measurement mode can be used to measure round-trip delay
   of a bidirectional SR path.  The IP header of the STAMP Session-Sender test 
   packet contains the Destination Address equals to the STAMP Session-Sender address
   and the Source Address equals to the STAMP Session-Reflector address. Optionally,
   the STAMP Session-Sender test packet can carry the return path information (e.g.
   return path label stack for SR-MPLS) as part of the SR header.  
   In this mode, the Control Code is set to 0 
   [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm] in the STAMP Session-Sender test packets.</t>

   <t>The received test packets are not punted at the STAMP Session-Reflector and it does
   not process them and generate reply test packets.
   As the test packet is not punted on the STAMP Session-Reflector for processing,
   the STAMP Session-Sender copies the 'Sequence Number' in 'Session-Sender Sequence Number' 
   directly before transmitting the test packet.  In this mode, as per Reference Topology,
   the timestamps T1 and T4 are collected by the test packets.
   Both these timestamps are used to measure round-trip delay as (T4 - T1).</t>

    <section title="Delay Measurement for P2MP SR Policies" anchor="sect-4.6"> <t>
   The Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) SR path
   that originates from a root node terminates on multiple destinations called leaf nodes 
   (e.g. P2MP SR Policy <xref target="I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy"/> 
   or P2MP Transport <xref target="I-D.shen-spring-p2mp-transport-chain"/>).</t>

   <t>The procedures for delay measurement described in this
   document for P2P SR Policies are also equally applicable to the P2MP SR Policies. 
   The procedure for one-way delay measurement mode is defined as following:</t>

   <t><list style="symbols"><t>The STAMP Session-Sender root node transmits test packets using the
      Tree-SID defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-pim-sr-p2mp-policy"/> for the

      <t>The STAMP Session-Sender test packets can contain
      the replication SID as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-sr-replication-segment"/>.</t>

      <t>The Destination Address is set to the loopback 
      address from range 127/8 for IPv4, or the loopback address ::1/128 for IPv6 address.</t>

      <t>Each STAMP Session-Reflector leaf node transmits its IP address in the Source
      Address of the reply test packets as shown in Figure 8.  This
      allows the STAMP Session-Sender root node to identify the STAMP Session-Reflector leaf nodes
      of the P2MP SR Policy.</t>

   <t>When using the Destination IPv4 Address from range 127/8, 
   the TTL field in the IPv4 header is set to 1.</t>

   <t>For link delay, the TTL field in the test packet is set to 1 in 
   one-way and two-way delay measurement modes.</t>

    </section>

   <section title="IPv6 Hop Limit" anchor="sect-4.5.2"><t>
   The Hop Limit field in the IPv6 and SRH headers of the
   STAMP Session-Sender and STAMP Session-Reflector test packets is 
   set to 255, except in the following cases.</t>

   <t>When using the Destination IPv6 Address of loopback address ::1/128, 
   the Hop Limit field in the IPv6 header is set to 1.</t>

   <t>For link delay, the Hop Limit field in the test packet is set to 
   1 in one-way and two-way delay measurement modes.</t>

   <section title="Router Alert Option" anchor="sect-4.5.3"><t>
   The Router Alert IP option (RAO) <xref target="RFC2113"/> is not set in the STAMP Session-Sender

   </section>
   </section>

   </section>

   <section title="Test Packet Loss for Links and SR Paths" anchor="sect-5"><t>
   The test packet loss measurement is applicable for connectivity 
   verification and continuity check in an SR network.
   The procedure defined in this document for delay measurement using STAMP test packets 
   can also be applied for test packet loss measurement for links and end-to-end SR paths.
   The procedure uses sequence number in the STAMP test packets as 
   described in Section 4 "Theory of Operation" of <xref target="RFC8762"/>.</t>
    </section>

   <section title="Direct Measurement for Links and SR Paths" anchor="sect-6"><t>
   Direct measurement is applicable to detect data packet loss in an SR network.
   The "Direct Measurement" TLV (Type 5) defined in <xref target="RFC8972"/> 
   can be used to detect data packet loss for links and end-to-end SR paths. 
   The Path Segment ID (PSID) from the received data packet 
   can be used to measure receive data packets for end-to-end SR path  
   on the STAMP Session-Reflector node.</t>

   </section>

     <section title="Liveness and Connectivity Loss Monitoring for Links and SR Paths" anchor="sect-7"><t>
   Liveness monitoring is applicable for connectivity verification and continuity check in an SR network.
   The procedure defined in this document for delay measurement using STAMP test packets 
   can also be applied to report the connectivity loss metric for links and end-to-end SR paths. 
   Connectivity loss is notified when consecutive N number of reply test packets are
   not received back at the STAMP Session-Sender, where N is locally provisioned value.</t>

   <t>Note that for one-way and two-way delay measurement modes, the connectivity loss detection 
   interval and scale for number of STAMP test sessions need to account for 
   the processing of the STAMP test packets on the STAMP Session-Reflector 
   which need to be punted from the forwarding fast path
   (to slow path or control plane) and reply test packets need to be injected.
   The scale is improved by using the STAMP test packets in 
   loopback mode as described in Section 4.2.3.</t>
   </section>

    <section title="ECMP Support for SR Policies" anchor="sect-8"><t>
   An SR Policy can have ECMPs between the source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.
   Usage of Anycast SID <xref target="RFC8402"/> by an SR Policy can result in ECMP
   paths via transit nodes part of that Anycast group.  The test
   packets need to be transmitted to traverse different ECMP paths to measure
   delay of an SR Policy.</t>

   <t>Forwarding plane has various hashing functions available to forward
   packets on specific ECMP paths.  The mechanisms described in
   <xref target="RFC8029"/> and <xref target="RFC5884"/> for 
   handling ECMPs are also applicable to the
   delay measurement.  In IPv4 header of the STAMP Session-Sender test packets,
   sweeping of Destination Address from range 127/8 can be used to exercise
   particular ECMP paths.  As specified in <xref target="RFC6437"/>, Flow Label field in
   the outer IPv6 header can also be used for sweeping.</t>

   <t>The "Destination Node Address" TLV <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/> can be transmitted 
   in the STAMP Session-Sender test packet to identify the intended destination node,
   for example, when using IPv4 Destination Address from the range 127/8.
   The STAMP Session-Reflector MUST NOT transmit reply test packet if it
   is not the intended destination node in the "Destination Node 
   Address" TLV <xref target="I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm"/>.</t> 

   </section>

   <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sect-9"><t>
   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in
   well-managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it
   assumes that a node involved in a measurement operation has
   previously verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the
   far-end STAMP Session-Reflector.</t>

   <t>If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the STAMP Session-Sender, of the counter or timestamp fields
   in received measurement reply test packets.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement
   disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid packet to a
   single test cycle.</t>

   <t>Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the test packets.  SRv6 has HMAC protection
   authentication defined for SRH <xref target="RFC8754"/>.
   Hence, test packets for SRv6 may not need authentication mode.
   Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration
   of access-control lists and firewalls.</t>
