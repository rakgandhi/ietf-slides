   Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and
   greatly simplifies network operations for Software Defined Networks
   (SDNs).  SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes.  SR takes advantage of the
   Equal-Cost Multipaths (ECMPs) between source and transit nodes,
   between transit nodes and between transit and destination nodes.  SR
   Policies as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy"/> are used
   to steer traffic through a specific, user-defined paths using a stack
   of Segments.  Built-in SR Performance Measurement (PM) is one of the
   essential requirements to provide Service Level Agreements (SLAs).</t>

   <t>The Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) provides
   capabilities for the measurement of various performance
   metrics in IP networks using probe messages <xref target="RFC8762"/>. 
   It eliminates the need for control-channel signaling by using
   configuration data model to provision a test-channel (e.g. UDP paths). 
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv"/>
   defines TLV extensions for STAMP messages.</t>

   <t>This document specifies procedures for sending and processing probe
   query and response messages for Performance Measurement in SR
   networks.  The procedure uses the mechanisms defined in <xref target="RFC8762"/> 
   (STAMP) and its TLV extensions <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv"/> 
   for Performance Measurement.
   The procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and
   is used for both Links and end-to-end SR Paths including SR Policies and Flex-Algo IGP Paths.  
   Unless otherwise specified, the mechanisms 
   defined in <xref target="RFC8762"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-option-tlv"/>

	<section title="Overview" anchor="sect-3"><t>
   For one-way and two-way delay measurements in Segment
   Routing networks, the probe messages defined in
   <xref target="RFC8762"/> are used.  For direct-mode and
   inferred-mode loss measurements, the probe 
   messages defined in [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm] are used. 
   For both Links and end-to-end SR Paths including SR Policies and Flex-Algo IGP Paths,
   no PM state for delay or loss measurement need to be created on the
   reflector node R5.</t> 
   
   <t>Separate UDP destination port numbers are user-configured for delay and loss
   measurements from the range specified in <xref target="RFC8762"/>. 
   As specified in <xref target="RFC8762"/>, the reflector supports the destination
   UDP port 862 for delay measurement probe messages by default. This UDP port however, is 
   not used for loss measurement probe messages. The
   sender uses the UDP port number following the guidelines specified in
   <xref target="sect-6"/> in <xref target="RFC6335"/>. The same destination UDP 
   port is used for Links and SR Paths and the reflector is 
   unaware if the query is for the Links or SR Paths. The number of UDP ports with 
   PM functionality needs to be minimized due to limited hardware resources.</t>

   <t>For Performance Measurement, probe query and response messages are
   sent as following:</t>

	<t><list style="symbols"><t>For delay measurement, the probe messages are sent on the
      congruent path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are
      used to measure the delay experienced by the actual data traffic
      flowing on the Links and SR Paths.</t>

	<t>For loss measurement, the probe messages are sent on the congruent
      path of the data traffic by the sender node, and are used to
      collect the receive traffic counters for the incoming link or
      incoming SID where the probe query messages are received at the
      reflector node (incoming link or incoming SID needed since the
      reflector node does not have PM state present).</t>

	</list>
	</t>

	<t>
   The In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM)
   mechanisms for SR-MPLS defined in <xref target="I-D.gandhi-mpls-ioam-sr"/> and for
   SRv6 defined in <xref target="I-D.ali-spring-ioam-srv6"/> are used to carry PM
   information such as timestamp in-band as part of the data packets,
   and are outside the scope of this document.</t>

	<section title="Example Provisioning Model" anchor="sect-3.1"><t>
   An example of a provisioning model and typical measurement parameters for each user-configured destination UDP port 
   for performance delay and loss measurements is shown in the following

	<section title="One-way Measurement Mode" anchor="sect-4.2.1"><t>
   In one-way measurement mode, the probe response message
   as defined in Figure 6 is sent back out-of-band to the sender node,
   for both Links and SR Policies. The Sender Control Code is set to
   "Out-of-band Response Requested". 
   In this delay measurement mode, as per Reference Topology, 
   all timestamps t1, t2, t3, and t4 are collected by the probes.
   However, only timestamps t1 and t2 are used to measure one-way delay as (t2 - t1).</t>

	<t> For one-way performance measurement, the sender node address may not
   be reachable via IP route from the reflector node.  The sender node
   in this case needs to send its reachability path information to the
   reflector node using Return Path TLV defined in [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].</t>

	</section>

	<section title="Two-way Measurement Mode" anchor="sect-4.2.2"><t>
   In two-way measurement mode, when using a bidirectional
   path, the probe response message as defined in Figure 6 is sent back
   to the sender node on the congruent path of the data traffic on the
   same reverse direction Link or associated reverse SR Policy
   <xref target="I-D.ietf-pce-sr-bidir-path"/>.  The Sender Control Code is 
   set to "In-band Response Requested".
   In this delay measurement mode, as per Reference Topology, 
   all timestamps t1, t2, t3, and t4 are collected by the probes.
   All four timestamps are used to measure two-way delay as ((t4 - t1) - (t3 - t2)).</t>

	<t>For two-way measurement mode for Links, the probe response message is sent back on the incoming physical
   interface where the probe query message is received.</t>

	<t>For two-way measurement mode for SR Policy, the reflector node needs to send
   the probe response message on a specific reverse path.  The sender
   node can request in the probe query message to the reflector node to
   send a response message back on a given reverse path (e.g. co-routed
   bidirectional path) using Return Path TLV defined in [I-D.gandhi-ippm-stamp-srpm].  
   This way the reflector node does not require
   any additional SR state for PM (recall that in SR networks, 
   the state is in the probe packet and signaling of the parameters is undesired).</t>

        <section title="Loopback Measurement Mode" anchor="sect-4.2.3"><t>
   The Loopback measurement mode can be used to measure round-trip delay
   for a bidirectional SR Path.  The IP header of the probe query
   message contains the destination address equals to the sender address
   and the source address equals to the reflector address. Optionally,
   the probe query message can carry the reverse path information (e.g.
   reverse path label stack for SR-MPLS) as part of the SR header.  The
   probe messages are not punted at the reflector node and it does
   not process them and generate response messages.
   The Sender Control Code is set to the default value of 0.
   In this mode, as the probe packet is not punted on the reflector node for processing,
   the querier copies the 'Sequence Number' in 'Session-Sender Sequence Number' directly.
   In this delay measurement mode, as per Reference Topology,
   the timestamps t1 and t4 are collected by the probes.
   Both these timestamps are used to measure round-trip delay as (t4 - t1).</t>

        <section title="Performance Delay and Liveness Monitoring" anchor="sect-7"><t>
    Liveness monitoring is required for connectivity verification and continuity check in an SR network.
    The procedure defined in this document for delay measurement using the STAMP probe 
    messages can also be applied to liveness monitoring of Links and SR Paths. 
    The one-way or two-way measurement mode can be used for liveness monitoring.  
    Liveness failure is notified when consecutive N number of probe response messages are
    not received back at the sender node, where N is locally provisioned value. 
    Note that for one-way and two-way modes, the failure detection interval and scale for number of probe messages need to account for 
    the processing of the probe query messages which need to be punted from the forwarding fast path
    (to slow path or control plane) and response messages need to be injected on the reflector node.
    This is improved by using the probes in loopback mode.</t>
         </section>

	<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="sect-8"><t>
   The performance measurement is intended for deployment in
   well-managed private and service provider networks.  As such, it
   assumes that a node involved in a measurement operation has
   previously verified the integrity of the path and the identity of the
   far-end reflector node.</t>

	<t>If desired, attacks can be mitigated by performing basic validation
   and sanity checks, at the sender, of the counter or timestamp fields
   in received measurement response messages.  The minimal state
   associated with these protocols also limits the extent of measurement
   disruption that can be caused by a corrupt or invalid message to a
   single query/response cycle.</t>

	<t>Use of HMAC-SHA-256 in the authenticated mode protects the data
   integrity of the probe messages.  SRv6 has HMAC protection
   authentication defined for SRH <xref target="RFC8754"/>.
   Hence, probe messages for SRv6 may not need authentication mode.
   Cryptographic measures may be enhanced by the correct configuration
   of access-control lists and firewalls.</t>
